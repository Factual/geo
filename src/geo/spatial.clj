(ns geo.spatial
  "Provides common interfaces for working with spatial objects and geodesics.
  All units are in meters/radians/steradians unless otherwise specified.
  Provides static spatial contexts for the earth, and some constants like the
  earth's radii and circumferences, along with points like the poles.

  Defines protocols for unified access to Points and Shapes, to allow different
  geometry libraries to interoperate.

  Basic utility functions for unit conversion; e.g. degrees<->radians.

  Functions for computing earth radii, surface distances, and surface areas.

  Constructors for shapes like bounding-boxes and circles, and utility
  functions over shapes for their heights, centers, areas, etc. Can also
  compute relationships between shapes: their intersections, contains, disjoint
  statuses, etc."
